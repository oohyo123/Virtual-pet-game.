# Virtual-pet-game.
For my A3 code project, I chose to use Scratch, which is a visual continuous language development platform. I created a virtual pet game and used the coding features to build various interactive games. A pet you can interact with, take care of, and give food to. Scratch doesn't use much text, but allows li'l encoders to move specific blocks around the screen and assemble programs.
